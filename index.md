### Welcome to My Projects

#### [Door Dash Project](/bank)
<!--For this project I used Excel. Excel tools shown are functions (COUNT, MAX, AVERAGE, SUM, MIN). Scatter plots, histograms, advanced if-then formulas, pivot tables, and VLOOKUPs. This was my first time using Excel and I can see why it is still used as a data visualization tool.-->
